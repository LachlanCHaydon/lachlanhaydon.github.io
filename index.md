## About Me

I am a dual-degree student at **Loyola University Chicago** pursuing a B.S. in **Physics** and a B.B.A. in **Information Systems & Business Analytics** graduating in May of 2026.  

I am currently researching lightning dynamics and terrestrial-gamma-flashes (TGFs) at Loyola with Dr. Rasha Abbasi for the Telescope Array Project. Quantative problem solving and making sense out of complex data is a passion I am trying to pursue. I am looking for new ways to apply the skills I've developed through my research experience.

## Experience

### **Physics Researcher *(Fellowship)***
**Loyola University Chicago** | *Jan 2025 – Present*

I research **Lightning Dynamics and Terrestrial Gamma-ray Flashes (TGFs)**. 
TGFs are brief, intense burst of high-energy light (gamma rays) that happens in the Earth's atmosphere, 
usually inside or above a thunderstorm. I am lucky enough to conduct research on these events.
Some of my responsibilities include: 

* Automate spectroscopic analysis technique to process high volumes of visual observations quickly
* Developed an interface to simplify the plotting techniques used to present results. 
* Analyzed high-speed phantom video data to study breakdown mechanisms in atmospheric electricity.
* Utilized Python for data analysis to correlate gamma-ray bursts with lightning leader development.
* Co-authored a manuscript currently in review and currently working on another.
  *A detailed summary of this work can be seen in my projects page*


### **Summer Intern Insurance Broker**
**Marsh** | *June 2025 – Aug 2025*

Last summer I interned at the largest insurance brokerage in the world, Marsh, as a summer associate
where I learnt the ins and outs of the comercial insurance industry. I was placed in the Middle-Market 
Casualty team, where I gained experience understanding coverages, negotiating with underwriters, and 
helping submit policies during the 7/1 busy season. 

### **Lead Writing Center Tutor**
**Loyola University Chicago** | *Sept 2023 – Dec 2024*

I started at the writing center my third semester of college, where I shared my writing expertiece and 
gave feedback students on their assignments. I was then promoted to lead tutor, giving me additional 
responsibilites such as training and menotring new employees, as well as promoting the center at campus events. 
I stepped down to spend time on Physics research, but enjoyed my time greatly in this role. I learnt 
so much about how to communicate effectively and get ideas off in a constructive manner.

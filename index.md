## About Me

I am a dual-degree student at **Loyola University Chicago** pursuing **Physics** and **Business Information Systems & Analytics** (Class of 2026). 

I bridge the gap between scientific inquiry and data-driven business solutions. My passion lies in applying mathematical rigor to complex problems, whether I'm analyzing lightning dynamics or optimizing business processes. 

Currently, I am a **Mulcahy Research Fellow** and exploring opportunities in finance, semiconductors, and Quantum Information Science (QIS).
